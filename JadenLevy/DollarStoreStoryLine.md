Oh dear, Dollar Tree announced that their prices will be going up to $1.25! You, as their most loyal shopper, will not stand for this. You WILL be leaving the store having paid only a dollar per item.

The object of the game is to steal the right number of items such that the total value of all items legally purchased is equivalent to the price of all items taken before prices were raised.

For instance, assume you want to leave the store with five items, which originally costed $5.00. To prove your point, you must legally purchase four items at $1.25 each and steal the remaining item.
