Oh dear, Dollar Tree announced that their prices will be going up to $1.25! You, as their most loyal shopper, will not stand for this. You WILL be leaving the store having paid only a dollar per item.

The object of the game is to purchase and steal the right number of items such that you still receive the same number of items at a value of $1.00 per item.

For instance, assume you want to leave the store with five items, which originally costed $5.00. To prove your point, you must legally purchase four items at $1.25 each and steal the remaining item.

Of course, the game isn't this easy. Security is on watch, and you have a 10% of being audited after leaving the store for "suspicious activity." If audited, each stolen item has a 90% chance of being found. If you're caught, you are arrested and banished from Dollar Tree for eternity.

Every item that has successfully been stolen has a 50% chance of decreasing the chance of being audited by 1% until just before 0% is reached (10% > 9% > 8% > ... > 1% > 100%). Once the audit chance is 100%, a cutscene is played where Mr. Dollar Tree himself gives you a $0.25/item discount after recognizing your efforts. You're selfish, so you'll take it.
